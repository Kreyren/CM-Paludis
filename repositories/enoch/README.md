Repository to define Enoch-inspired functions

Gentoo Linux (previously Enoch) is rolling-release Linux distribution that is using package manager named `portage` which inspired creation of paludis to resolve common issues and malpractice within the software development.

Paludis defines it's own Work In Progress Enoch API (EAPI) named `exheres` designed for Exherbo Linux <https://exherbo.org>, but also has support for EAPI defined by Gentoo Developers for the use on Gentoo Linux that is not compatible with exheres.

Mokleus is inspired by both distribution into a standalone EAPI
